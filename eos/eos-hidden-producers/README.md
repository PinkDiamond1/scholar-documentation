# EOS "Hidden" Producers

For those interested in running "hidden" producer nodes, with listeners open to the public.

> How best to configure this? Ideally our producer would only talk to a very limited set of others (ideally just our listeners nodes, but would also be the 121 BPs)

Just place a machine behind a firewall somewhere and connect from it out to other producers.
Put a full node for incoming traffic, that you connect to from your producer as well.
